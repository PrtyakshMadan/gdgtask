In titanic survival prediction we trained 3 models 
1.Logistic Regression
2.RandomForest Classifier
3.KNN
best performance (f1 score) is shown by Random Forest Regressor 
KNN algorithm is performing best to classify positive class in the dataset
Logistice regression's algorithm doesnt work so well as all relations b/w input parameters and target would not be linear
classification report of all models are given in the jupyter notebook
